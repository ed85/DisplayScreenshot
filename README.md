Java Screenshot

# Describe:
I'm not the one who made a new fire finder. Code below you would probably find somewhere else. Probably could be better described and coded, but... There are no restrictions to reuse this code. With this in mind, feel free to make this code usable...

Best Regards!

# Screenshot CLASS

To test this code, you need to create the "img" folder with the "flysea-com.jpg" file as background.
Besides the "screenshot" class, you can download the "img" file to see the correct image in the JFrame.

It doesn't really matter if you download the file or create your own, what matters is that you place the folder in the relative path.
