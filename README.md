# Describe:
I'm not the one who can find a new fire. Code below would you find probably somewhere else. Probably could be better described and coded, but...There is no restrictions to reuse this code.In this sense, feel free to make this code usable...

# Screenshot CLASS

To test this code you must create "img" folder with file "flysea-com.jpg" for background.
Beside "screenshot" class, you can Download the "img" file to see proper image in JFrame.

It is actually not important whether you Download the File in included or create a yours, important is to place the folder in Relative path.
